# Kayai Anticheat

## Overview

Kayai Anticheat is a comprehensive anti-cheat solution designed specifically for Minecraft servers. Its primary objective is to detect and prevent the usage of ghost and blatant modules, ensuring a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.

## Features

### 1. Ghost Module Detection

Kayai Anticheat employs advanced algorithms to identify and combat ghost modules effectively. Ghost modules are often subtle and attempt to manipulate the game without being easily detectable. Our system is tuned to recognize and block such modules, providing a level playing field for all participants.

### 2. Blatant Module Detection

Blatant modules are those that operate openly and disrupt the gameplay experience for others. Kayai Anticheat is equipped with mechanisms to quickly detect and take action against blatant modules, maintaining a fair and enjoyable environment for legitimate players.

### 3. Real-time Monitoring

The anticheat system continuously monitors player activities in real-time. By analyzing player behavior and game interactions, Kayai Anticheat can swiftly identify suspicious patterns and take preventive measures to stop potential cheaters.

### 4. Customizable Configurations

Server administrators have the flexibility to customize the anticheat configurations to suit the specific needs of their Minecraft community. Fine-tune detection thresholds, enable or disable certain checks, and adapt the anticheat to the unique characteristics of your server.

### 5. Data-Driven Detection

To ensure a high correct detection rate, we've personally, with the help of the community, collected over 100 million cheating data, including autoclick patterns, aim assist, fakelag, and much, MUCH more.

### How it works

We've collected millions of data with the help of our community from popular clients like Vape, Drip, Slinky, and more. This process has taken us over 6 months. We have compiled this data into an advanced algorithm that can easily detect normal, regular clicks (including double clicks) versus simulated clicks and double clicks. We call this algorithm "K.D.A" Kayai Detection Algorithm.
On the potpvp servers: MMC (Minemen.club), duels.us, kaiya.rip (eu + na). We've tested our client-side algorithm/anticheat with beta-tester (cheaters) to test our anticheat. The clients used were Slinky, Drip Lite, Vape V4 and Entropy.club.  You can see the stats below.
