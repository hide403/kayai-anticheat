# Kayai Anticheat

## Overview

Kayai Anticheat is a comprehensive anti-cheat solution designed specifically for Minecraft servers. Its primary objective is to detect and prevent the usage of ghost and blatant modules, ensuring a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.

## Features

### 1. Ghost Module Detection

Kayai Anticheat employs advanced algorithms to identify and combat ghost modules effectively. Ghost modules are often subtle and attempt to manipulate the game without being easily detectable. Our system is tuned to recognize and block such modules, providing a level playing field for all participants. It uses the K.D.A system. Currently the ghost module correct detections procent is 82%, 5% higher than kaiya.rip, 20% higher than MMC and 12% higher than duels.us. Keep in mind. Kayai is still in development and not closed to be finished and is already outclassing multiple popular servers.

### 2. Blatant Module Detection

Blatant modules are those that operate openly and disrupt the gameplay experience for others. Kayai Anticheat is equipped with mechanisms to quickly detect and take action against blatant modules, maintaining a fair and enjoyable environment for legitimate players. This is a mostly for servers with gamemodes like: bedwars, bedfight, bridge, etc. 

### 3. Real-time Monitoring

The anticheat system continuously monitors player activities in real-time. By analyzing player behavior and game interactions, Kayai Anticheat can swiftly identify suspicious patterns and take preventive measures to stop potential cheaters. It will automatically warn all staff members online right before banning the cheating player. This means that staff members can also check the user banned for cheating/suspicous gameplay, because sometimes human vision is needed.

### 4. Customizable Configurations

The server owners or selected people like staff members, have the flexibility to customize the anticheat configurations to suit the specific needs of their Minecraft servers. Fine-tune detection thresholds, enable or disable certain checks, and adapt the anticheat to the unique characteristics of your server. This includes 30+ customizable settings and more than 15+ custom features only the Kayai Anticheat has.

### 5. Data-Driven Detection

To ensure a high correct detection rate, we've personally, with the help of the community, collected over 100 million cheating data, including autoclick patterns, aim assist, fakelag, and much, MUCH more. This was the combined effort of the developers of Kayai Anticheat, owners and the community who all wants to have a fair and level playing experience without a cheater-infested pvp scene.

### How it works

We've collected millions of data with the help of our community from popular clients like Vape, Drip, Slinky, and more. This process has taken us over 6 months. We have compiled this data into an advanced algorithm that can easily detect normal, regular clicks (including double clicks) versus simulated clicks and double clicks. We call this algorithm "K.D.A" Kayai Detection Algorithm.
On the potpvp servers: MMC (Minemen.club), duels.us, kaiya.rip (eu + na). We've tested our client-side algorithm/anticheat with beta-tester (cheaters) to test our anticheat. The clients used were Slinky, Drip Lite, Vape V4 and Entropy.club.  You can see the stats below.
